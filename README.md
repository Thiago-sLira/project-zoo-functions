<h1>Zoo Functions</h1>
<p>The city hall asked me to organize the information about the city zoo!!</p>

<h2>🚀 Objective</h2>
<p>I developed functions that fetch information about the animals in the zoo, such as species and place of origin. In addition, I also gathered data about the people who collaborate with the maintenance and care of the zoo.</p><br>
<p>The biggest challenge at the time was to understand how the information was structured and how to solve the proposed challenges.</p>

<h2>🛠️ Built with</h2>

<span><strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong></span><br>
<span><strong><em>Higher Order Functions</em></strong></span><br>
<span><strong><em>Tests with Jest</em></strong></span><br>
